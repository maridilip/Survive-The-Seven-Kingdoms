Ser Byron is a hedge knight traveling the length and breadth of Westeros looking for employment and tournaments.

On his travels Ser Byron has drawn up a map of towns and castles where he can find lodging and hopefully employment as well as areas for camping in between.

His map is a simple grid:

[["Deepwood Motte",  "Shadow Tower",      "Castle Black",   "Eastwatch",      "Bay of Seals"],
 ["The Stony Shore",  "Torrhen's Square", "Winterfell",     "The Dreadfort",  "Karhold"],
 ["Flint's Finger",   "Barrowtown",       "Moat Cailin",    "White Harbour",  "Widow's Wat"],
 ["Pyke",             "Seagard",          "The Twins",      "Sisterton",      "The Fingers"],
 ["The Crag",         "Riverrun",         "Darry",          "The Eyrie",      "Gulltown"],
 ["Castamere",        "Acorn Hall",       "Harrenhal",      "Maidenpool",     "Dragonstone"],
 ["Lannisport",       "Stoney Sept",      "King's Landing", "Blackwater Bay", "Sharp Point"],
 ["High Garden",      "Bitterbridge",     "King's Wood",    "Storm's End",    "Evenfall"],
 ["Old Town",          "Horn Hill",       "Prince's Pass",  "Planky Town",    "Sunspear"]];

calculate where he might find himself after a time in the saddle given a starting position and a journey of directions and distances.
Example:

For ("Winterfell", S5), the output should be "King's Landing".
Input/Output

    [input] string currentPos
    The starting position.
    Will be a string inside the map array.

    The directions.
    Will be a string of cardinal directions with an integer separated by spaces.

    [output] a currentPos
    The final postion.
